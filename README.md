# Stealify
provides a framework for creating language-agnostic tools like debuggers, profilers, or other instrumentations. In general, it provides a standardized way to express program code enabling cross-language research and the development of tools that are developed once and then can be applied to any language. As also aims to have some of the fastest Runtime Implamentations for many languages like Javascript Servers. 


Stealify is a Framework to adopt Frameworks and Software it aims to provide methods and tools for fast adopting developing production deploy and production serve your apps and servers or apis. It uses the Graal Framework as its fundamental building block to create high performant Applications, Tools, Utils and Servers.

## Short Why?
- Faster Development
- Better Controle over the execution
- Security
- Reduced Operational Costs
- Build to Last principles via modular software encapsulation!

## Stealify the Software encapsulation Framework Concept
Software Stacks today are composed out of many software products and connected via the network that is a hugh problem to maintain and run efficently stealify is about encapsulation so it creates Software Products that are build out of other Software Products and abstracts away the network overhead it enables to design or lets say Compose Software out of Many Products to define the behavior of your Software. Maximum code Reuse and Security paired with unparalled Productivity that was not possible before are only 3 of the endless features that you get on this way for free. It will change the way you code and design Software total.

It allows you to Combine your Javascript code with a low level language like Java so you could let your Javascript code use
The best parts and tools from the Java Ecosystem with the Power of a Scripting Language like Javascript fully flexible run able embbeded, standalone or even Compiled to a single optimized binary.

Stealify aims to solve the biggest Problems of the NodeJS Runtime the creator of it rayen dahl did a talk 10 things i regret about NodeJS. like beeing tied to npm, like gype and c bindings hell, security. Read the full story and how all this is addressed.

The Documentation aims to be a Complet Software Development Guide for Coding Highperformance Applications and turn them into complet automated Autonomous Systems that take autark decissions for error handling and operations.

## Why ECMAScript / ES6+ / Javascript / Node is focused?
Because it has proven that it is one of the best languages when it comes to massured coder productivity.
It is a language that many people can learn and understand easy they are able to produce valueable running prototypes
in less time. Also near any Software today is a Distributed System that offers a Webinterface or App so you will have at last one Javascript coder around in Any Project! And at all Stealify Concepts and the Main Installer are Polyglot so it is still useable It is a GraalVM based Framework while Parts or lets even say modules of it can be used even also directly with NodeJS or any Other Runtime like the browser.

## Why Graal?
Its a Binary Compileable Polyglot Runtime that 

## What is It for?
- event-driven automation for auto-remediation, security responses, troubleshooting, deployments, and more. Includes rules engine, workflow, 2M+ integrations
- Generate Reactive Server and Client Side Applications and Manage/Monitore them from Dev to Production.
- Reduce Security Risks via our Unikernel Tools to use Only what you Really Need and don't add extra Security issues.
- We Power already some of the biggest server and Client Applications form Companys like Yahoo, Apple and many more.

## What is It not for?
- We are not aware of a single usecase that would not fit into this. You are free to submit issues.

## What is it more exactly?
A Framework and Essential tooling for A high performance implementation of the JavaScript programming language. Built on the GraalVM Framework by Oracle Labs. That Supports Node.js applications, including native packages. Offering Complet Application SDK's for Reallife Usecases that is Full compatibility with the latest ECMAScript specification as also Executes JavaScript code with best possible performance. It Allows simple upgrading from Nashorn or Rhino based applications via Fast interoperability with Java, Scala, or Kotlin, even with other GraalVM languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, or R. the whole implamentation and your software will also be Be embeddable in any systems like IoT, Databases for example Oracle RDBMS or MySQL. Any Mix is possible.

# How it Works?
- Its minimalistic
- It has a big Ecosystem the biggest in the world as its able to adopt Ecosystems :)
- Its build to last. So it saves Investments.
- Works with any Software on Any Operating System via Nativ code so you can Code Cross Plattform.
- Stealify is like the Bible for Developers and Operators as also everyone that is Tech Interrested.

## TODO
- Make Realtime more easy
- Finish PHP Integration
- Many Many tutorials
- Browser behavior and api's
- Showing Application distribution Patterns
  - Introduce direktspeed permissions concept of a shared OS binding platform for all apps. Its a solution for API's that chrome does not has finished yet.

# Get it?
On Linux 
```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
wget 
``` 
Via Docker

## Core Components
- graalvm
- vertx
- stealify-ignite (https://ignite.apache.org/whatisignite.html)
- atomx
- stealify-zookeeper
- stealify-grafana
- stealify-k8s

## Anti Patterns
- Inharitance is not for code ReUSE Functions are for reuse and Class Composition are for reuse. Mixins are not really for reuse 
- Using require is a code smell for old code use import that is static analyzeable and brings instand improvements.

## confusing but true info
- Build your Frontend's using html and Stealify WebComponents
- Build your Backends using Stealify-backend Modules like SSR for Stealify WebComponents so you can Render them Server Side or use the Stealify backend-api Framework. To Design Service Layers that are Consume Able by Any Software.
- It has 4 Modular Core Components: Stealify Model(Reactive Model), Stealify Connect(Connects Reactive Models with any Database or API), Stealify Database(Engagement database), Stealify View(Creates Interactive Views for any Device and Browser)

- is used on DIREKTSPEED OS - Server 
- is used by Nils Infra the Infrastructure Manager using nils+stealify to supply imutable Infrastructures and Manage Complet Infrastructure and Application LifeCycles for Production and Development
